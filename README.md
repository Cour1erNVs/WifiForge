# About Wifi-Forge

Wi-Fi Forge provides a safe environment for learning WiFi hacking via [Mininet-Wifi](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) and [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet), which creates software defined networks within a single host machine. Wi-Fi Forge provides pre-built labs that can be setup and completed with minimal overhead all from a single laptop without any additional hardware.

## Important Notes

- Mininet and Mininet-Wifi only runs on Linux operating systems. 
- It is suggested to run Mininet on Ubuntu version 14.04 or greater. 
- The Mininet-Wifi installation script may disrupt normal operating system use, it is suggested to use a fresh install or virtual machine.
